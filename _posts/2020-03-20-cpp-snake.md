This project started with the idea of practicing and reminding myself coding in C++ in the Linux OS. It is helpful for remembering some basic information of C++ classes, structures and data structures in this language. The code is based on the implementation made by ThePoorEngineer [here](https://www.thepoorengineer.com/en/snake-cplusplus/). There are several variations though, because the original code is written for the Windows OS, so had to do some changes in a few libraries used and in the way some of the information is displayed.

As of now, this is a vanilla version of the game. You can move up (with key 'w'), left (with key 'a'), down (with key 's') and right (with key 'd'). The screen has a counter for the score at the bottom and when the game finishes below the playground you will see the final score. This is a project in progress, since there are a few upgrades I have in mind in order to make the game more challenging (perhaps let the user choose the difficulty level at the beginning of the game).

Below you can find a video with a short game of the software:

If you want to run the code in your computer, make sure you have g++ installed in your Linux OS. Clone the repository [here](https://github.com/juliosol/cpp_snake_game_linux). Then, run the following command to compile the files. 
```
g++ -o linux_snake linux_snake.cpp -lncurses -lpthread
```

Finally, to play run the command:
```
./linux_snake
```
