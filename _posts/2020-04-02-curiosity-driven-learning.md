This project was an attempt to extend the paper [Large-scale Study of Curiosity-Driven Learning](https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/resources/largeScaleCuriosity2018.pdf) by Peetak et. al. In particular, we attempted to improve the learning framework by allowing the agent to generate predictions of two-steps at a time instead of doing predictions one-step at a time. 

This was a project developed for the course EECS 598 Deep Learning at University of Michigan in collaboration with Kushantha Attanayake,Ruchir Aggarwal, Dennis Li and Poorani Ravindhiran. 

You can find the document with the final results [here](https://juliosol.github.io/multi_step_project/resources/EECS598_012_Final_Report.pdf)

The first video we show has intermediate results from training the agent. In this case, Mario seems to learn something, but it's "playing" yet.

The last video presented show results of the agent learning more and advancing quite more into the first level.
