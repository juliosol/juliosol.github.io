Welcome, this is a website to store some of my personal projects and notes.

I am interested in working in applications that make use of machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning. Right now, I am actively looking for working opportunities in any industry where I can pursue my interests artificial intelligence with applications in computer vision. If you have any opportunity or know anybody that has one and think I am a good match, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

The website is in constant construction, but thanks for stopping by! Feel free to get in touch!
