# About Me

Hello! I'm Julio Soldevilla, a science enthusiast experiment with sharing knowledge. In this page I intend to share fun projects or interesting in-depth and math based learning I do. The idea is the page to serve as a learning journal for my own use (and if people find it insightful then it's even better.)

## Contact

Thanks for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
